# About

This is a dummy landing webpage for a corporate gifting company.

# UX/UI Principles 

I have incorporated the following UX/UI guidelines in this project:

1. Easy navigation of links by changing text color/ underlining text upon hovering.
2. Each line has 60 or less characters to simplify reading.
3. All buttons enlarge when hovered on to convey clickability.
4. Complementary colours used to make different elements of the landing page stand out.
5. Typographic hierarchy incorporated to give structure to landing page.
6. Grey and Lavender colours given for text instead of White to reduce eye strain while reading.

# Tools used

1. HTML
2. CSS
